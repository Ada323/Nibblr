# Nibblr

Nibblr makes it easy to find eating buddies in Austin. Whether you're a foodie looking for fellow
restaurant enthusiasts or if you're simply tired of eating alone, Nibblr is for you.

Nibblr was created with love by Mike, Nate and Molly using the following stack:

AngularJS
JQuery
Node/Express
MySQL
Material Design Lite
Google Places API

NOTE: Before running the project, be sure to change the MySQL login information in
server/db/index/js to match your MySQL login.

To run the project, clone the repo and run npm install then npm start.
